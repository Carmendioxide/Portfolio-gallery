        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="body-text">
            I am an aspiring content creator and multimedia designer. As of 2021 I have two years design experience. All the work contained on this site was created by me including the web design.
            The content herein is fictional and a subject of many a design application briefs for jobs I had applied to. These are but some of the work I've submitted. 
            At present I'm busy exploring the wonderful world which is design and I've only just scratched the surface. The world is a beautiful place and there's inspiration everywhere you look.
            I don't really know what to add to this section other than that you should check out my work because it speaks for itself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The content on this page were created by myself. The website is my first and I was very tempted to just grab a template online and edit it according to what I needed - I mean, that's what templates are there for...right? Eventually I elected to design it from scratch. It's not responsive nor very fancy at this point but I'll edit it as I go along. I really wanted to get it out there for now to prove to myself that I actually have the courage to do it and also because it's important to have one. I'll tweak and add more content as time goes by but at 28th of June 2021, this is what I've managed to come up with. Maybe I should add one of those,"our website is under construction" signs instead. I really dislike them. At least with this not so good website a viewer can still view my content (preferably on a desktop for my own sake) and reach out if they do have questions.
           
        </p>
        <p class="second">
            I offer branding kits for start-up companies as well as companies that are looking to rebrand. If your company is looking for social media content or marketing content for both print and digital purposes then I will be able to assist as well. If you are having a private function or you require a design for your private event I can do that too. I truly enjoy design and I enjoy bringing ideas to life. <br><br>If any of the above apply to you please feel free to discuss with me and I'll be grateful to make your dreams a reality. I do want to thank you for checking out my site. If there's anything you reckon I could do for you, please do let me know. It would make my day.
